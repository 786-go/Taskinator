### Description
This app could be dubbed a "glorified to-do list"; it allows one to schedule tasks that need to be completed and then move them along to being "in progress" and then finally to being "completed". The purpose of this project was to gain experience in dynamically generated JavaScript. 

### Installation
None. The program runs smoothly in the browser. 

### Usage
None. The CSS makes this program intuitive and enjoyable to use.
